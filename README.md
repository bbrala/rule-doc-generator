## Usage

### 0. Are you New to Monorepo?

The best to lean-in fast is to read basic intro at blog post [All You Always Wanted to Know About Monorepo](https://www.tomasvotruba.com/blog/2019/10/28/all-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-monorepo-but-were-afraid-to-ask/#what-is-monorepo).
We also made a simple command to make that easy for you:

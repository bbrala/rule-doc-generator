Do you maintain [a monorepo](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2019/10/28/all-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-monorepo-but-were-afraid-to-ask/) with more packages?

**This package has few useful tools, that will make that easier**.

## Install

```bash
composer require symplify/gerudoc --dev
```

## Usage

### 0. Are you New to Monorepo?

The best to lean-in fast is to read basic intro at blog post [All You Always Wanted to Know About Monorepo](https://www.tomasvotruba.com/blog/2019/10/28/all-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-monorepo-but-were-afraid-to-ask/#what-is-monorepo).
We also made a simple command to make that easy for you:

```bash
vendor/bin/monorepo-builder init
```

Happy coding!
